# R Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various clustering algorithms in R Studio. Clustering algorithms are unsupervised learning techniques used to identify natural groupings or clusters within a dataset.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **KMeans_Clustering.R**: Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.
- **Hierarchical_Clustering.R**: Implementation of hierarchical clustering techniques.
- **DBSCAN_Clustering.R**: Implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm.
- **Evaluation_Methods.R**: Various evaluation methods for assessing clustering results.

## Usage

Each script includes detailed comments and instructions on usage. Load your dataset, adjust parameters, and run the script to perform clustering analysis.
